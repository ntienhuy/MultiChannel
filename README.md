# MultiChannel
Multi-channel LSTM-CNN model for Vietnamese sentiment analysis

This is implementation for this paper "Multi-channel LSTM-CNN model for Vietnamese sentiment analysis".

We provide a sentiment analysis dataset: VS. The dataset include two version: tokenized and without tokenized.

To run this code: 
1. Please specify a data path in preprocessing.py and load_data.py.
2. Run "python preprocessing.py" and then "python cnn_lstm.py"


Requirement:
1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
